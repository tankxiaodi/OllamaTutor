{AI_NAME}: Those are great reasons. Japanese food is delicious!

{AI_NAME}: No, but I'd love to go see the shrines and gardens there.
Student: Me too. What shrine would you like to visit?
{AI_NAME}: I've heard Fushimi Inari is beautiful. Have you seen pictures of it?
Student: No, I haven't. What's special about it?
{AI_NAME}: It's known for thousands of orange torii gates. What about you?
Student: I want to see Tokyo Tower.
{AI_NAME}: Good choice! Did you know it's inspired by the Eiffel Tower?
Student: Really? I didn't know that. Is it as tall?
{AI_NAME}: It's actually taller! What's another place you'd like to see in Japan?
